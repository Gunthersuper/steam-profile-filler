The third degree
The triumph of hope over experience
The upper hand
The usual suspects
The whole kit and caboodle
The whole nine yards
The whole shebang
The writing is on the wall
The wrong side of the blanket
The year dot
The Yellow Peril
There is more than one way to kill a cat
There are three kinds of lies...
There but for the grace of God, go I
There is no alternative
There's an R in the month
There's method in my madness
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no place like home
There's no such thing as a free lunch (Tanstaafl)
There's no such thing as bad publicity
There's one (a sucker) born every minute
There's one law for the rich and another law for the poor
They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance

Tit for tat
Tits up
To a T
To all intents and purposes
To be or not to be, that is the question
To beggar belief
To boldly go where no man has gone before
To boot
To cast the first stone
To err is human; to forgive divine
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub
To the manner born
To the nth degree
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive

Yellow Peril
You are what you eat
You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
You can lead a whore to culture but you can't make her think
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't hold with the hare and run with the hounds
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You get on my wick
You look as if you've been dragged through a hedge backwards
You'll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent
Young turk
Your days are numbered
Your money or your life
Your name is mud
You've never had it so good
Zero tolerance
Zig-zag
